It&rsquo;s a beautiful video accompanied by pleasant music where at times I felt like maybe the abstractions being built are a bit too stretched and janky, maybe because I don&rsquo;t fully understand the scope of its usage. Nonetheless, the video tries to show how accommodating the notations and abstractions built are to various other games.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6reLWfFNer0">How to Build a Startup Without Funding by Pieter Levels</a><ul><li>Pieter Levels who has built multiple companies (notably nomadlist, remoteok) talks about his process of building and launching stuff.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUFvA9Dr0bA">History of the entire Church, I guess&mldr;</a><ul><li>Before watching this I didn&rsquo;t even know Christianity had so many denominations. With my very limited understanding of religions, it looks like, unlike Hinduism where the groups get created primarily out of the abundance of gods and thus different worshippers of different gods (I&rsquo;m simplifying obviously, there are other different reasons groups get created), in Christianity where there is primarily one sole entity the denominations seem to get created on the different interpretations of the saying of god or who/what god is. Of course, it&rsquo;s not as simple as that, as the video gets to there are denominations that have formed during different times in history to align the concept and make it more amiable to the time.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiKg3zifRXQ">Scientists whose lives were total dumpster fires</a><ul><li>Among others, it covers the life story of Guillaume Le Gentil, an astronomer who wanted to observe the transit of Venus to measure the distance from the Earth to the Sun but to put it lightly the circumstances didn&rsquo;t allow for it.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=links>Links&nbsp;<a class=headline-hash href=#links>🔗</a></h2><ul><li><p>A very interesting <a href=https://www.netinterest.co/p/insuring-the-unknown-ee1>article on the reinsurance industry</a>. It provides an introduction to what it does and more interestingly taking a specific example of Berkshire Hathaway how it does. One of the highlights for me was how not over-specifying risk is an important thing when dealing with unknowns. Although Ajit Jain (Berkshire&rsquo;s key underwriter) talks about how they <a href="https://youtu.be/ecDIns2OqqM?t=72">start out with as much science as possible</a>, post a certain point over-specifying an unknown is an act in self-delusion. The general tendency when over-specifying is in some sense similar to removing the slack out of a system, the more granular you go the more you think you&rsquo;ve covered the space and the more confidence you get in removing broad-level estimates.</p></li><li><p>Research and work on defensive tactics against AI have come back into the spotlight, in particular people have been worried about the problem of how to identify AI-generated content. There are efforts on various fronts on this problem such as <a href=https://haveibeentrained.com/>Have I Been Trained</a> which allows you to search through a public text-to-image dataset to see if your content has been used to train these large models. But one of the more interesting approaches is <a href=https://www.theverge.com/23553406/radioactive-data-malicious-ai-detection>&ldquo;radioactive data&rdquo;</a>. The idea being you embed some pattern into your content ideally non-noticeable to humans but which will have a recognizable effect on the trained models and this minor pattern can then be used as a sort of marker to identify if the output of a model has been trained on the tainted content. Scott Aaronson has similarly been working in OpenAI to do something similar for text generated via GPT, although I don&rsquo;t know much detail about this, he suggests it&rsquo;s a much more <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6823#:~:text=One%20thing%20I%20like%20about%20this%20approach%20is%20that%2C%20because%20it%20never%20goes%20inside%20the%20neural%20net%20and%20tries%20to%20change%20anything%2C%20but%20just%20places%20a%20sort%20of%20wrapper%20over%20the%20neural%20net%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20actually%20possible%20to%20do%20some%20theoretical%20analysis">&ldquo;wrapper&rdquo; kind of functionality outside of the core model</a>. To me this is distinct in that the approach is stemming more from model producer angle, rather than the &ldquo;radioactive data&rdquo; approach which is more stemming (at least theoretically ) from the content creator angle</p><ul><li>Similar to the news article this week on ChatGPT being used to create malware, these tools are starting to set up new grounds for adversarial long-running cat-and-mouse games.</li><li>On a slightly unrelated note, an interesting change that seems to be happening in AI research compared to earlier is that in some of the research in the periphery of AI such as fitness evaluation of AI for specific tasks, political inclinations of models, seems to be looking at the core model as essentially a black box, and then using that model as a system under test to identify various characteristics of the model. It&rsquo;s probably a reaction to both the complexity of the model as well as lack of direct access to these large and expensive models or maybe looking at the model as a black box is probably the right abstraction for these problems. If it is the latter then this might have been the abstraction level for a lot of older research as well, but I personally haven&rsquo;t been too deep in the space to know about these research.</li></ul></li><li><p>An article from MIT Technology Review on <a href=https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/01/12/1066589/bitcoin-mining-boom-kazakhstan/>Bitcoin mining in Kazakhstan</a>. I would have never guessed that Kazakhstan was the second-largest country in terms of hash rate in 2021.
