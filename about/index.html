I spend a lot of time thinking about technology, business, strategy, and the intersection between them. More specifically Iâ€™m interested in how strategic choices influence technology and to some extent how technological choices once made become constraints for strategy. Iâ€™m fortunate enough to have people around me who are also interested in some of these things and we have fun conversing about these things. A bunch of the ideas that I write about would either have originated from those conversations or would have been in some shape or form influenced by them."><meta itemprop=wordCount content="268"><meta property="og:url" content="https://adityarsuryavamshi.github.io/about/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Aditya"><meta property="og:title" content="About"><meta property="og:description" content="ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Aditya!

The first is primarily for me to write down some of the commonly occurring themes and concepts that I have noticed and think about so that they can be used as a reference or building blocks in the future. And the second reason which is more of hope is that the contents of the blog will lead to/will be extensions of the conversation I have so much fun having with my friends.</p><p>As such I would love to hear from you and if you have anything to say please feel free to contact me.
